Key is to try and keep the hierarchy as flat as possible, reducing the number of clicks to get there, often using conjoined folder names rather than adding extra nesting depth.

All physical paper documents/letters are scanned if if they can't be thrown away asap and kept on file in the appropriate folder in case they are needed. Result is a paperless office with only one folder in a safe they must have documents (e.g. passports, birth certificates, deeds)
